# Pet project in rust: CLI Task Manager

### Now it only implements some basic functionality:
1. Add/remove task
2. Mark task completed
3. List all tasks
4. Save the tasks on disk using serde to have some persistence

### TODO:
1. Update task (title/description/date)
2. Utilize `clap` to make the interface more user-friendly
3. Documentation
4. Some additional features


### Plans after finishing
As it is a pet-project to get the hang of rust, the next logical step would be to extend the project for it to work in web using something like `actix`
